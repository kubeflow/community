# Hosting Kubeflow Community Meetings

Author(s): Edd Wilder-James [@ewilderj](http://github.com/ewilderj)

## Prerequisites

* You should be a member of the [community-meeting-hosts@](https://groups.google.com/a/kubeflow.org/forum/#!forum/community-meeting-hosts) group. 

## Setting up the meeting

* Ensure that somebody with Zoom recording permissions will join. Currently,
  this is either Edd Wilder-James or Michelle Casbon.

No less than 24 hours before the meeting, circulate the agenda and notes Google
doc:

1. This Google doc is hosted at
   [bit.ly/kf-meeting-notes](http://bit.ly/kf-meeting-notes) and is editable by
   members of
   [community-meeting-hosts@](https://groups.google.com/a/kubeflow.org/forum/#!forum/community-meeting-hosts).
   It is viewable by the public, and anybody subscribed to
   [kubeflow-discuss@](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubeflow-discuss)
   may make comments and suggest changes.
   
2. Copy the template agenda from the bottom, add your name as host, then
   incorporate agenda items. Agenda items are queued up on the first page of the
   doc. Be sure to bring up action items from the previous meeting into their
   own section at the top.
   
3. Circulate the agenda document to the mailing list, along with a reminder of
   the Zoom call in details. You can get these from previous messages, as they
   remain constant.

## Running the meeting

Arrive to the meeting at least 5 minutes before its assigned time. The meeting
should be configured that new arrivals are muted by default, to reduce noise.
Usually, you'll need to tell people at the start time that you'll wait a couple
of minutes to allow everybody to arrive.

Post a link to the agenda & notes into the relevant Slack channel: for the main
community meeting, this is *#community*.

Ensure that the person responsible for Zoom recording has started the recording.

Kick off by welcoming people, reminding them of the Slack channel for feedback,
and the link for agenda/notes. Hand off to the team member driving the agenda,
if it is not you.

Remind people of some good practices:

* The meeting is public and will be recorded, let people know this.

* It's hard to know who's talking, so attendees should introduce themselves
  before making a comment.
  
* If you can't get into the conversation and want to contribute, post to the
  Slack channel and tag the meeting moderator to get attention.

* Folks should add relevant links and info into the meeting doc, rather than the
  Zoom channel, as the Zoom chat will go away at the end of the meeting.

## Taking notes

If you are not going to be the note-taker, ensure there is a designated
volunteer to take notes before discussion starts. They should have edit
permissions for the notes doc.

Ensure that action items that people have agreed to are clearly noted.

## After the meeting

* Edit the notes for clarity, applying formatting to separate discussion items.

* Ensure that action items are tagged to the community members responsible: the
  easiest way to do this is highlight and add a comment tagging their email
  address with a `+` sign.
  
* For Zoom owners: when Zoom emails you to say the audio recording is available.
  Download the video file (or audio file if there are no demos) and upload it
  into the `Recordings` folder of the [team
  drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/150C-v6Hb8gtPZMucyd_65ozyCiY50zFD).
  Then copy the share link for this file and add the link into the notes doc.
  
* Ask the Zoom owner to add the link if they haven't done already.
  
* Circulate the notes link to the mailing list, and include some highlights in
  the message so people can figure out if they want to read the notes or listen
  to the recording.
  
## That's it!

If you have suggestions or improvements, please submit a PR to this
documentation or discuss it on the group mailing list.
