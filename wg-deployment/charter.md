# WG Deployment Charter

This charter adheres to the conventions, roles and organization management outlined in [wg-governance].

## Scope


Include a 2-3 sentence summary of what work WG TODO does. Imagine trying to
explain your work to a colleague who is familiar with Kubeflow but not
necessarily all of the internals.

### In scope

#### Code, Binaries and Services

- kfctl
- kfdef for each platform

#### Cross-cutting and Externally Facing Processes

- Cutting releases on both the manifests and kfctl repos
- Qualifying a Kubeflow release for each platform
- Co-ordinating with application OWNERs before a release to qualify application releases

### Out of scope

- Maintaining or bug fixes to the individual applications themselves.

## Roles and Organization Management

This WG adheres to the Roles and Organization Management outlined in [wg-governance]
and opts-in to updates and modifications to [wg-governance].
