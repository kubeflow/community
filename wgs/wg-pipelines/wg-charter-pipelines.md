# ML Pipelines Charter

This charter adheres to the conventions, roles and organization management outlined in [wg-governance].

## Scope

The goal of the Kubeflow Pipelines project is to build a Kubernetes optimized stack for creating and deploying ML Pipelines and enabling a rich ecosystem of pipelines components and tools. ML Pipelines project has the goal of enabling simple and reliable productionalization of autonomous ML workflows, advancing the standards of ML Engineering and making them available to a large community of users across various Kubernetes deployment options.


### In scope

#### Code, Binaries and Services

Backend Servers
- ML Pipelines user facing APIs 
- Storage abstraction and integration components for pipelines
- Pipelines Orchestration Engine
Includes Argo and Tekton based forks, as well as new versions of orchestrators
- Metadata Store that tracks pipeline artifacts, their lineage and dependencies as well as the ML Metadata Service exposing the Metadata APIs, and the Metadata collection agent
- Pipeline job scheduling controller, and continuous pipeline execution services

FE and UI
- Pipelines Templates UI
- Experiment tracking and run exploration UI
- Metadata Tracking and Lineage Exploration UI
- Metadata metric visualization 

Tools
- Authoring SDK for components and pipelines
- Tools for pipeline creation and deployment
- CLI for interacting with Pipelines API

Deployment
- Deployment scripts and tools for deploying ML Pipeline service components on Kubernetes engines of various cloud providers and on-prem deployments

Pipeline Content
- Cloud specific integration components
- HW and SW vendor specific components
- Pipeline examples for different ML use cases

Documentation
- Concepts documentation 
- Cloud provider specific documentation
- Documentation for the SDK and REST API
- Documentation for the sample components and pipelines 


#### Dependencies
ML Pipeline projects may have dependencies on the following projects managed by other KF work groups:
- KF User Profiles Controller
- KF Central UI Console
- Notebook and KF integration of Notebooks
- TF Job and other training controllers
 
#### Initial set of subprojects governed by ML Pipelines WG
- KFP Backend (mainline), incl. all backend servers
- KFP Tekton Backend (fork)
- KFP UI
- KFP SDK/DSL/CLI, including samples
- Metadata Backend, API and UI 
- Components and pipelines content in KF repo


#### Cross-cutting and Externally Facing Processes

ML Pipelines WG defines the following processes for the included projects:

- Community meetings
- Release and validation processes 
- Issue triaging and prioritization (focusing on decision making process)
- Feature and roadmap planning


## Roles and Organization Management

This WG adheres to the Roles and Organization Management outlined in [wg-governance] and opts-in to updates and modifications to wg-governance.

The positions of the Chairs and TLs are granted to the organizations and companies participating in the workgroup governance. If an individual leaves the organization to which that position was designated - the organization will have the right to appoint others to these roles.


### Subproject Creation

New [wg-subprojects] need to be reviewed and approved by the WG Tech Leads.
