If your group has a regular meeting, talk to
[@ewilderj](https://github.com/ewilderj) about getting it added to the calendar.

### Kubeflow community call

The project team holds a weekly community call on Tuesdays. This call alternates
weekly between US East/EMEA and US West/APAC friendly times. Joining the
[kubeflow-discuss](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubeflow-discuss)
mailing list will automatically send you calendar invitations for the meetings, or you can subscribe to the community meeting calendar above.


Agenda, notes, and a reminder of the next call are sent to the kubeflow-discuss
mailing list.
