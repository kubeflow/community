The responsibilities of the Interim KSC includes:
1. Establish KSC, KCC and KTOC
1. Create committee charters
1. Work with CNCF TOC to complete the due diligence review

## Kubeflow Steering Committee
The governance of Kubeflow is an open, living process and document, and will continue to evolve as the community and project change.

The Interim KSC is chartered to establish KSC. The interim committee will propose details of the KSC charter, roles, processes and limitations under this document.

KSC will replace the interim committee after CNCF accepts Kubeflow as an incubation project.
