*[This document is work in progress. It will be moved to https://github.com/kubeflow/community/GOVERNANCE.md upon completion and approval. This document drew a lot of inspirations from [Knative governance](https://github.com/knative/community/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md).]*

Kubeflow Governance consists of three components.

## Kubeflow Steering Committee (KSC)

At a high level, the [Kubeflow Steering Committee (KSC)](./STEERING-COMMITTEE.md) is the "root" level governance body.

KSC is responsible for the general health of the Kubeflow community. Responsibilities include maintaining the governance framework, code of conduct, community meetings, communication platforms, and test resources.

## Kubeflow Conformance Committee (KCC)

The [Kubeflow Conformance Committee (KCC)](./CONFORMANCE-COMMITTEE.md) is responsible for management, licensing, and conformance verification of Kubeflow logos, names, and trademarks, including the definition of what "Kubeflow" is and the definition and rules for usage of derived marks.

KCC operates within a protected governance umbrella in parallel with the KSC. As such, the KSC may investigate and enforce Code of Conduct actions against members of the KCC, but may not alter the charter or governance of the KCC rules.

## Kubeflow Technical Oversight Committee (KTOC)

The [Kubeflow Technical Oversight Committee (KTOC)](./TECH-OVERSIGHT-COMMITTEE.md) is responsible for the technical oversight, release process, and integration of the technology components of the Kubeflow project. KTOC delegates most day-to-day work to various subject-specific working groups.
KTOC operates entirely within the governance definitions delineated by the KSC.
