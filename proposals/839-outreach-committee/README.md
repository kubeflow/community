# KEP- 839: Proposal for the Creation of the Kubeflow Outreach Committee (KOC)

## Overview

We propose the creation of the **Kubeflow Outreach Committee (KOC)** to lead efforts in growing and engaging the broader AI/ML community, not just the Kubeflow community. This committee will be responsible for fostering visibility, engagement, and inclusivity, as well as helping to expand Kubeflow’s presence and user base.

## Objectives

- Lead efforts to grow and engage the AI/ML community through events, educational materials, and advocacy for Kubeflow.
- Onboard new contributors and users to Kubeflow, particularly from diverse and underrepresented communities.
- Collaborate with other committees and working groups to align outreach activities with the broader goals of the Kubeflow project.
- Foster a welcoming, inclusive, and diverse community within Kubeflow.

## Committee Structure

- **Appointment of Members**: Members will be appointed by the Kubeflow Steering Committee (KSC) at their discretion. Members can also be removed for violating the CNCF Code of Conduct.
- **KOC Co-Leads**: Co-leads will be established Kubeflow community members, with new members being appointed from both within and outside of the Kubeflow community. The co-leads will focus on driving growth and engagement.
- **Expansion**: The KOC will have the authority to appoint new members with the approval of one KSC member.

## Next Steps

1. Discuss and approve the formation of the KOC.
2. Appoint initial members and co-leads.
3. Begin defining the committee’s first outreach initiatives.

We look forward to your feedback and support on this proposal.
