# KEP- 839: Proposal for the Creation of the Kubeflow Outreach Committee (KOC)

## Overview

We propose the creation of the **Kubeflow Outreach Committee (KOC)** to lead efforts in growing and engaging the broader AI/ML community, not just the Kubeflow community. This committee will be responsible for fostering visibility, engagement, and inclusivity, as well as helping to expand Kubeflow’s presence and user base.

## Objectives

- Lead efforts to grow and engage the AI/ML community through events, educational materials, and advocacy for Kubeflow.
- Onboard new contributors and users to Kubeflow, particularly from diverse and underrepresented communities.
- Collaborate with other committees and working groups to align outreach activities with the broader goals of the Kubeflow project.
- Foster a welcoming, inclusive, and diverse community within Kubeflow.

## Committee Structure

- **Chairs**: The Outreach Committee will be co-chaired by established Kubeflow community members, with the Chairs being responsible for guiding the committee’s work. New members of the KOC may be newcomers to the community, and their primary role will be focused on helping drive growth for Kubeflow. Importantly, Chairs will have explicit voting responsibilities.
- **Leads**: Leads of the Kubeflow Outreach Committee are appointed at the discretion of the KOC and majority vote of the KSC.

Members of the KOC, both Chairs and Leads, must adhere to the CNCF Code of Conduct. The removal of any members for violating the CNCF Code of Conduct is also at the KSC's discretion through a majority vote.
