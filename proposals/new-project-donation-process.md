# KEP-748: Project Donation to Kubeflow

## Summary
This KEP outlines how community members can donate their project to the Kubeflow community.

## Motivation
As Kubeflow has become a well established ecosystem and community, several
projects may want to be donated to the Kubeflow platform to explicitly join our 
community.

### Goals
This goal of this process is to give clear guidelines and set expectations 
for community members about how to be formally included into Kubeflow and 
the application process.

The decision making process will be separate from the application process and is at the 
discretion of the Kubeflow Steering Committee. The application and data provided are 
critical for the KSC to make an informed decision that is best for the longetivity 
of the project and community.

### Non-Goals
- Give specific recommendations for evaluating any individual project.
- Supporting project add-ons.

## Proposal
The process for donation is intended to be simple but thorough.

Project owners or maintainers will apply for donation by following a four
step process. 

The process is outlined in six steps:

1. Create a GitHub Issue with a Google Document outlining your proposal (please allow for commentary)
2. Submit a Pull Request with the [../proposals/new-project-donation-process.md](application form).
3. Add your proposal to the Kubeflow Community call to introduce and collect feedback on
the application.
4. Work with the Kubeflow Outreach Committee to send an announcement email in `kubeflow-discuss` and publish messages on Slack, LinkedIn, X/Twitter, and other Kubeflow social resources
5. Schedule meeting with Kubeflow Steering Committee for initial vote and to collect feedback.
6. Merge or close the Pull Request depending upon the outcome of the final vote.

### Notes/Constraints/Caveats (Optional)

Note that this application does not gaurantee acceptance of the proposed project to Kubeflow.

### Risks and Mitigations

Two major risks for Kubeflow accepting projects are:
1. Accepting projects that do not have active contributors or a healthy user base
- This is why metrics are meant to capture this
2. Impacting the delivery speed of Kubeflow releases
- It will be expected that the maintainers invest in incorporating the project into the manifest or it will be removed

## Drawbacks

How could this new project harm the Kubeflow community?

## Alternatives

What other open source projects are there like the one proposed? 
Why should Kubeflow accept the one proposed?
