## Motivation
PyTorch is a popular machine learning framework which currently does not have an operator/controller for Kubernetes. This proposal is aimed at defining what that operator should look like, and adding it to Kubeflow.

## Goals
A Kubeflow user should be able to run training using PyTorch as easily as then can using Tensorflow.  This proposal is centered around a Kubernetes operator for PyTorch. A user should be able to run both single node and distributed training jobs with PyTorch.

This proposal defines the following:
- A PyTorch operator
- A way to deploy the operator with ksonnet
- A single pod PyTorch example
- A distributed PyTorch example

## Non-Goals
For the scope of this proposal, we won't be addressing the method for serving the model.

## API (CRD and resulting objects)

### Custom Resource Definition
The custom resource submitted to the Kubernetes API would look something like this:
```yaml
apiVersion: "kubeflow.org/v1alpha1"
kind: "PyTorchJob"
metadata:
  name: "example-job"
spec:
  backend: "gloo"
  masterPort: "23456"
  replicaSpecs:
    - replicas: 1
      ReplicaType: MASTER
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
            - image: pytorch/pytorch:latest
              name: master
              imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
    - replicas: 2
      ReplicaType: WORKER
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
            - image: pytorch/pytorch:latest
              name: worker
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
```

This PyTorchJob resembles the existing TFJob for the tf-operator.  The main differences being the omission of the parameter server replica type, and the addition of `masterPort` and `backend` options.

`backend` Defines the protocol the PyTorch workers will use to communicate when initializing the worker group. Information on the different backends (and the functions they support) can be found [here](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/distributed.html).

`masterPort` Defines the port the group will use to communicate with the master's Kubernetes service.

### Resulting Master
```yaml
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: pytorch-master-${job_id}
spec:
  selector:
    app: pytorch-master-${job_id}
  ports:
  - port: 23456
    targetPort: 23456
```
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pytorch-master-${job_id}
  labels:
    app: pytorchmaster-${job_id}
spec:
  containers:
  - image: pytorch/pytorch:latest
    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
    name: master
    env:
      - name: MASTER_PORT
        value: "23456"
      - name: MASTER_ADDR
        value: "localhost"
      - name: WORLD_SIZE
        value: "3"
        # Rank 0 is the master
      - name: RANK
        value: "0"
    ports:
      - name: masterPort
        containerPort: 23456
  restartPolicy: OnFailure
```

The master spec will create a service and a pod.  The environment variables provided are used when initializing a distributed process group with PyTorch. `WORLD_SIZE` is determined by adding the number of replicas in both 'MASTER' and 'WORKER' replicaSpecs. `RANK` is 0 for the master.

### Resulting Worker
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: py-torchjob-worker-${job_id}
spec:
  containers:
  - image: pytorch/pytorch:latest
    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
    name: worker
    env:
    - name: MASTER_PORT
      value: "23456"
    - name: MASTER_ADDR
      value: pytorch-master-${job_id}
    - name: WORLD_SIZE
      value: "3"
    - name: RANK
      value: "1"
  restartPolicy: OnFailure
```

The worker spec generates a pod. They will communicate to the master through the master's service name.

## Design
This is an implementaion of the PyTorch distributed design patterns, found [here](http://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/dist_tuto.html), via the lense of TFJob found [here](https://github.com/kubeflow/tf-operator). In the case of Kubernetes, because the operator is able to easily apply configurations to each process, we will use the environment variable initialization method found [here](http://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/dist_tuto.html#initialization-methods).

In most training examples, the pods will communicate via the all-reduce function in order to average the gradients.

## Alternatives Considered
One alternative considered for the CRD spec is shown below:
```yaml
apiVersion: "kubeflow.org/v1alpha1"
kind: "PyTorchJob"
metadata:
  name: "example-job"
spec:
  backend: "gloo"
  masterPort: "23456"
  worldSize: 3
  container:
  - image: pytorch/pytorch:latest
```
The idea was the number of replicas for worker and masters could be derived from the `worldSize` given there would only be one master. It was decided against based on the fact that it deviates from a regular replicaSpec and provides less customization.
