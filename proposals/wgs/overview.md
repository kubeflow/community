# Kubeflow Working Group Governance Proposal

## Objective ## 

1. Define the processes for forming and governing Kubeflow working groups.
1. Push technical and project decision making down to WGs
1. Push operational responsibilities(releases, testing, etc...) down to WGs

## Background ##

In 2019 the Kubeflow community approved the [Kubeflow Governance Model]. 
A major pillar of KF's governance model is working groups that own subprojects.
At the time, formation of WGs and the precise processes by which WGs would operate
was delayed until KF was large enough to warrant WGs.

KF has now reached a size where forming WGs is critical to sustaining and growing
the community.

This proposal aims to formalize the governance of WGs. The proposal
is based on how Kubernetes SIGs operate. In particular, the following
docs were used as starting points and then adopted to fit Kubeflow:
