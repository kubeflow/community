## Summary

This proposal requests adoption of the Spark History Server MCP project into the Kubeflow ecosystem. The [Spark History Server](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/monitoring.html#web-uis) is [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/index.html)'s built-in web UI service that provides access to information about completed Spark applications, including job execution details, stage performance, and task-level metrics. Our project provides a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables AI agents to analyze this Spark application data through natural language queries, complementing the existing Kubeflow Spark Operator with intelligent observability capabilities.

## What is Spark History Server?

The Spark History Server is a web application that serves as the central repository for monitoring completed Apache Spark applications. It provides:

- **Application Monitoring**: Web UI for viewing completed Spark application details
- **Event Log Storage**: Persistent storage of Spark application event logs (typically in HDFS, S3, or local filesystem)
- **Performance Metrics**: Job, stage, and task-level execution statistics
- **Resource Usage**: Executor memory, CPU utilization, and storage metrics
- **Historical Analysis**: Timeline view of application execution and performance trends

The Spark History Server is essential for post-mortem analysis and performance optimization of Spark workloads, but currently requires manual navigation through complex web interfaces to extract insights.

## Motivation

Kubeflow users running Spark workloads currently lack AI-powered troubleshooting capabilities. While the Spark Operator handles job lifecycle management, users must manually analyze Spark UI logs, metrics, and performance data when jobs fail or perform poorly.

### Problem Statement
- Manual analysis of Spark performance issues is time-consuming
- Lack of intelligent troubleshooting capabilities  
- No natural language interface for Spark observability
- Disconnected monitoring tools that don't integrate with AI workflows
- Complex Spark History Server web UI requires expertise to navigate effectively

##  How It Works

- Users interact with AI tools to ask questions about Spark performance
- Spark History Server MCP (this proposal) processes queries and fetches data from Spark History Server
- Spark Operator continuously writes event logs to Spark History Server
- MCP Server returns AI-powered analysis and recommendations to users

## Benefits

### First AI Tool for Data Processing
- **Pioneer AI Integration**: First AI-powered observability tool in Kubeflow ecosystem for data processing frameworks
- **Natural Language Interface**: Enables data engineers to troubleshoot Spark using conversational AI instead of manual UI navigation
- **MCP Standard Adoption**: Leverages emerging Model Context Protocol for standardized AI agent integration

### Enhanced Spark Operations
- **Intelligent Diagnosis**: AI-powered root cause analysis for failed or slow Spark jobs

## Migration Plan

### GitHub Repository

1. **Repository Transfer**: Transfer from `DeepDiagnostix-AI/spark-history-server-mcp` to `kubeflow/spark-history-server-mcp`
2. **API Alignment**: Update Kubernetes resources to use `kubeflow.org` API group
3. **Documentation**: Migrate docs to Kubeflow website and create integration tutorials
4. **Standards Adoption**: Align with Kubeflow branching, versioning, and configuration patterns

## Existing Solutions

While several Spark monitoring solutions exist, none provide the AI-powered natural language interface specifically designed for Kubeflow environments:

### Current Spark Observability Tools
- **Spark UI**: Basic web interface for Spark monitoring
- **Spark History Server**: Historical job analysis (what our MCP enhances)
- **Prometheus + Grafana**: Metrics-based monitoring dashboards
- **Custom Solutions**: Organization-specific monitoring tools

### Unique Value of Spark History Server MCP
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Only solution providing natural language interface for Spark troubleshooting
- **MCP Standard**: Leverages emerging Model Context Protocol for AI agent integration
- **Kubeflow Native**: Specifically designed for ML/AI workflow optimization
- **Multi-Framework Support**: Works with 5+ AI frameworks (LangChain, Claude, Strands, Amazon Q, LangGraph)
