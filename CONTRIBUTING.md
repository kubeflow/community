# Kubeflow Contributor Guide

Welcome to the Kubeflow project! We'd love to accept your patches and 
contributions to this project. Please read the 
[contributor's guide in our docs](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/about/contributing/).

The contributor's guide

* shows you where to find the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) that you need 
  to agree to,
* helps you get started with your first contribution to Kubeflow,
* and describes the pull request and review workflow in detail, including the
  OWNERS files and automated workflow tool.
