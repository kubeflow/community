# Kubeflow Inclusivity

This document is a guide to inclusivity for leaders involved in the Kubeflow
project. It describes conscious efforts and behavior patterns that contribute
to an inclusive environment where Kubeflow members feel safe to collaborate.

The Kubeflow community is a global group of contributors with a wide variety of
backgrounds. As such, leaders are expected to take purposeful steps to ensure
sustainability of the collaborative space. This is essential for project health
and future growth. Expectations of community leaders are as follows:

## Carve out space

Carve out well-defined spaces for contribution. Encourage members of the
community to engage in these spaces. Reach out to specific individuals to let
them know you think they would be a good fit.

## Get out of the way

Get out of the way when someone steps up. Give them ownership and set
expectations for delivery and accountability. Follow up on those expectations.
If you have concerns or need more information, increase the frequency of
communication rather than taking over or overstepping.

## Make opportunities

Seek out situations that provide opportunities for members of the community.
Examples of this include connecting event organizers with potential speakers,
introducing leaders to individual contributors, and inviting others to
collaborate. Consciously drive the creation of opportunities in areas that
community members want to grow in.

## Ask members where they want to grow

Find out which areas community members want to grow in. This could be in the
form of 1:1 conversations, small groups, or weekly meetings. Ask how you can
help.

Rather than making assumptions and assigning tasks, ask people where they want
to contribute and help them figure out how to make the most impact. Stretch them
just enough that they can see progress and sustained growth.

## Encourage members to ask for what they want

Encourage members of the community to make requests. That could be for
improvements to the product, community, or their own personal growth. Respond
to these requests with kindness and fairness.

Ask for volunteers and make time for the community to bring up topics they care
about.

## Explicitly call out challenges

Name specific challenges that affect members of the community and state your
position on how to resolve them.

Make statements such as, "I understand how difficult it must be to X," and "I
wish you didn't have to face such blatant challenges doing Y." Simply
acknowledging the struggle is an act of empathy that makes it easier to face
these challenges. Offer advice on how to deal with them or just be there to
commiserate.

## Give clear, specific, and actionable feedback

Be proactive about providing feedback, but ask first and be kind. Include
concrete steps that can be taken to improve the outcome and steer clear of
criticism involving something that cannot be reasonably changed.

## Treat everyone with respect

Set an example and uphold that standard. Do not tolerate double standards or
casual deprecation, even in jest. Ensure that community members understand the
group is open to everyone.

## Follow up on complaints

When you observe a
[code of conduct](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
violation or become aware of one, follow through on enforcing community
standards. Do this with care, showing respect and kindness for everyone
involved. These instances have a broader impact than just the involved parties,
since they set downstream expectations for the entire community.

This is a responsibility that the Kubeflow project does not take lightly, since
it directly impacts the ability of members to feel safe in the community.

## Indicators of success

It can be difficult to assess whether these efforts are effective. In many ways,
success can be invisible since it involves the prevention of conflict. A few
indicators are:

* Diverse membership across various dimensions (geographic, corporate, level of
  experience, etc.)
* Presence of members from frequently marginalized groups
* Continued engagement by long-term members
* Sentiment within the community that ideas are heard and contributions valued
* Accountability of leaders by members
