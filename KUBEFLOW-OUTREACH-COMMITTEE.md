# Kubeflow Outreach Committee (KOC)

The Kubeflow Outreach Committee (KOC) is a committee dedicated to fostering growth, engagement, and community outreach for the Kubeflow project. It will focus on activities that promote Kubeflow to new and existing users, contributors, and stakeholders while building an inclusive, vibrant, and diverse community within the broader AI/ML ecosystem.

The governance of the Kubeflow Outreach Committee will evolve as the community grows, ensuring that outreach activities remain relevant and impactful.

### Charter

1. Promote the vision, values, and mission of the Kubeflow project in collaboration with the KSC and WG Leads.
2. Lead efforts to grow and engage the AI/ML community, including organizing events, producing educational materials, creating and sharing content on social media, and advocating for Kubeflow across various tech communities.
3. Help grow the community by bringing new contributors and users to Kubeflow, particularly through accessible resources and community-building initiatives.
4. Collaborate with other committees and working groups to align outreach efforts with the broader goals of the Kubeflow project.
5. Encourage contributions to the Kubeflow Website and Blog, including project documentation, examples, and other educational materials.

### Limitations

Because the actions of the KOC may be perceived to represent the views of the wider Kubeflow project, the KSC places the following limits and requirements on the KOC.

1. The KOC may not endorse, recommend, or promote any product, service, or project except that which is directly provided by Kubeflow without approval by the KSC for each specific occasion.
2. All material published and events organized by the KOC must be exclusively under the "Kubeflow Community" brand, and not that of other organizations or individuals without approval by the KSC for each specific occasion.
3. The KOC may not enter into any partnerships or create co-branded material (including with other open-source projects) without approval by the KSC for each specific occasion.
4. The KOC may not authorize the usage of any trademarks, any such requests must be referred to the KSC.
5. The KOC may not enter into any contracts or other legal obligations, any such requests must be referred to the KSC.
6. The KOC must not organize any events or gatherings without approval by the KSC for each specific occasion.

In all cases, approval by the KSC refers to the normal decision process outlined in the KSC charter. 
### Committee Structure

- **Chairs**: 
    - The Kubeflow Outreach Committee will be co-chaired by established Kubeflow community members, with these Chairs being responsible for guiding the committee’s work.
    - KOC Chairs are appointed and removed by a decision of the KSC.
    - Importantly, chairs are the only role which may participate in decision votes.
- **Leads**: 
    - KOC Leads will help KOC Chairs execute on their outreach strategy. For example, post to Kubeflow social media accounts, review blog posts, publish YouTube videos, help with events, or other items that fall under the KOC charter. 
    - Leads of the KOC are nominated by the KOC Chairs, and confirmed by a decision of the KSC. The KOC Chairs may remove a KOC Lead at their discretion. 
    - KOC Leads must inform the KOC Chairs of any significant actions they take.

Members of the KOC, both Chairs and Leads, must adhere to the CNCF Code of Conduct. The removal of any members for violating the CNCF Code of Conduct is also at the KSC's discretion through its normal decision process. 

## Committee members

The KOC may have at most three (3) Chairs and five (5) Leads. Seats on the KOC are held by an individual, not by their employer.

### Limitations on Company Representation
No more than one Chair seat may be held by employees of the same organization (or conglomerate, in the case of companies owning each other). 

Separately, no more than two Lead roles may be held by employees of the same organization (or conglomerate, in the case of companies owning each other). Additionally, no more than one Lead and one Chair can be held by employees of the same organization (or conglomerate, in the case of companies owning each other). 

If employers change because of job changes, acquisitions, or other events, in a way that would be in violation of the proceeding limits, sufficient members of the committee must resign their positions until the requirements are satisfied. If it is impossible to find sufficient members to resign, all employees of that organization will be removed and the vacancies will be filled using the normal process.

In the event of a question of company membership (for example evaluating independence of corporate subsidiaries) a majority of all non-involved KSC members will decide.


### Committee Meetings

The KOC will meet regularly (at least monthly, or as needed), and these meetings will be open to the public. Specific sensitive matters, such as code of conduct violations or confidential discussions, may be handled separately.

Meeting notes will be publicly available to the community, except when privacy is required for specific discussions.

### Decision Process

Decisions requiring a vote include:

- Nominating a new KOC Lead for KSC approval
- Removing a KOC Lead
- Granting or removing access to any social media account or other elevated permission
- Proposing a new event or gathering to the KSC for approval
- Proposing a new partnership or co-branded publication to the KSC for approval
- Any other decisions that at least half of the chairs (rounded down) present decide requires a vote

Decisions are made in meetings when a quorum of the chairs are present and may pass with at least half the chairs (rounded up) supporting it.

Quorum is considered reached when at least half of the chairs (rounded up) are present.

Chairs of the KOC may abstain from a vote. Abstaining chairs will only be considered as contributing to quorum, in the event that a vote is called in a meeting.
