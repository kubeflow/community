# Kubeflow Outreach Committee (KOC)

The Kubeflow Outreach Committee (KOC) is a committee dedicated to fostering growth, engagement, and community outreach for the Kubeflow project. It will focus on activities that promote Kubeflow to new and existing users, contributors, and stakeholders while building an inclusive, vibrant, and diverse community within the broader AI/ML ecosystem.

The governance of the Kubeflow Outreach Committee will evolve as the community grows, ensuring that outreach activities remain relevant and impactful.

### Charter

1. Promote the vision, values, and mission of the Kubeflow project in collaboration with the KSC and WG Leads.
2. Lead efforts to grow and engage the AI/ML community, including organizing events, producing educational materials, creating and sharing content on social media, and advocating for Kubeflow across various tech communities.
3. Help grow the community by bringing new contributors and users to Kubeflow, particularly through accessible resources and community-building initiatives.
4. Collaborate with other committees and working groups to align outreach efforts with the broader goals of the Kubeflow project.
5. Contribute to the Kubeflow Website, documentation, demonstration, and educational material for the Kubeflow community.

KOC Leads will help KOC Chairs execute on their outreach strategy. For example, post to Kubeflow social media accounts, review blog posts, publish YouTube videos, help with events, or other items that fall under the KOC charter. The KOC Leads should inform the KOC Chairs on important decisions but KOC Chairs are ultimately the decision makers. 

### Committee Structure

- **Chairs**: 
    - The Kubeflow Outreach Committee will be co-chaired by established Kubeflow community members, with these Chairs being responsible for guiding the committee’s work.
    - KOC Chairs are appointed and removed by a decision of the KSC.
    - Importantly, chairs are the only role which may participate in decision votes.
- **Leads**: Leads of the Kubeflow Outreach Committee are appointed at the discretion of the KOC and majority vote of the KSC.

Members of the KOC, both Chairs and Leads, must adhere to the CNCF Code of Conduct. The removal of any members for violating the CNCF Code of Conduct is also at the KSC's discretion through a majority vote. 

## Committee members

The KOC may have at most three (3) Chairs and five (5) Leads. Seats on the KOC are held by an individual, not by their employer.

### Limitations on Company Representation
No more than one seat may be held by employees of the same organization (or conglomerate, in the case of companies owning each other). 


### Committee Meetings

The KOC will meet regularly (at least monthly, or as needed), and these meetings will be open to the public. Specific sensitive matters, such as code of conduct violations or confidential discussions, may be handled separately.

Meeting notes will be publicly available to the community, except when privacy is required for specific discussions.

### Decision Process

The KOC aims to reach consensus on all decisions. If a decision requires a vote, the decision will pass with a simple majority of the members present. 

Decisions are made in meetings when a quorum of the members are present and may pass with at least half the members (rounded up) of the committee supporting it.


### Committee Members

The Kubeflow Outreach Committee is composed of volunteers from the Kubeflow community, with a focus on individuals who are passionate about growing Kubeflow’s user and contributor base and expanding its presence within the broader AI/ML community.

### Changes to the Charter

Changes to the KOC charter can be proposed by any community member via a GitHub PR. Amendments will be subject to approval by a standard decision of the KSC. Proposals will be available for at least one week for community comments before a vote occurs.
