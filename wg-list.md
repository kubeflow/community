# SIGs and Working Groups

Most community activity is organized into Special Interest Groups (WGs),
time bounded Working Groups.

WGs follow these [guidelines](wgs/wg-governance.md) although each of these groups may operate a little differently
depending on their needs and workflow.

Each group's material is in its subdirectory in this project.

When the need arises, a [new WG can be created](wgs/wg-lifecycle.md)
