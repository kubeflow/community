# Kubeflow Steering Committee
The Kubeflow Steering Committee (KSC) is the governing body of the Kubeflow project, providing decision-making and oversight pertaining to the Kubeflow project policies, sub-organizations, and financial planning, and defines the project values and structure.

The governance of Kubeflow is an open, living document, and will continue to evolve as the community and project change.
