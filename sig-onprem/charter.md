## Scope

SIG On Premises 

### In scope

#### Product Functionality

This SIG aims to develop best practices for Kubeflow deployments in on-prem environments.

- Ensure that users have access to a list of validated reference designs for setting up a Kubeflow cluster.
- Ensure that a process is defined that will enable users to contribute to reference designs.
- Ensure that there is always at least one working and validated complete software stack. This software stack would be defined as a list of OSes and component versions that have been verified to create a working solution.


#### Cross-cutting and Externally Facing Processes

- Maintain testing infrastructure to provide a well-tested architecture for Kubeflow on-prem deployment.
- Coordinating with other Kubeflow WG to ensure they are aware of issues in on-prem deployments where appropriate.
- Coordinating with release teams to ensure they are aware of issues in on-prem deployments.
- Maintaining a list of hardware stacks known to work with Kubeflow.
- Maintaining instructions on how to verify a working stack.
- Maintaining a template for how to run benchmarks to verify a performant stack.

### Out of scope

- Providing fixes for every issue found for on-prem deployments.
- Providing root-cause analysis for every issue found.
- Maintaining manifests for Kubeflow on-prem deployments.
