# Templates

This directory contains the templates a release team member might need
throughout the release.

## [notes](releases/templates/notes.txt)

After each release meeting, a release team member should email the [kubeflow-discuss mailing list](https://groups.google.com/u/1/g/kubeflow-discuss) to update the community about the discussed items.

This email aims to contain an overview of the discussion points and decisions made during the meeting. This way, people can be up to date with the progress of these meetings even if they can't participate.
