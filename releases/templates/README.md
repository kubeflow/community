# Templates

This directory contains the templates a release team member might need
throughout the release.

## notes

After each release meeting a release team member should send an email to the
mailing list, to give an update about the discussed items.

The goal of this email is to contain an overview of the discussion points and
decision that were maid. This way people can be up to date with the progress of
these meetings, even if they can't participate
